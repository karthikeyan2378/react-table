# **App Name**: React Data Stream Table

## Core Features:

- High-Performance Table Rendering: Efficiently render and update a large, dynamic table with React.
- Virtualization Support: Dynamically adjusts rendering based on scroll position for handling 1000+ rows per second update speed
- Customizable Cell Rendering: Implement a custom cell renderer for high customization for different column types.
- Column Resizing and Reordering: Enable users to resize and reorder columns based on their needs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) to evoke a sense of calmness and clarity, reflecting the efficient management of streaming data.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#D3D3D3), almost white to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Sea green (#2E8B57) for highlighting important data or interactive elements, providing a contrast and drawing user attention.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text; Inter provides a modern, neutral look for tabular data and remains legible in large tables.
- Simple and intuitive icons for sorting, filtering, and any interactive elements within the table.
- Clean, modern, and sparse layout with sufficient whitespace for readability in a dense data environment.
- Subtle transitions for data updates and user interactions (e.g., column resizing, sorting).
